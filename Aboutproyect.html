--------------------------------------------Introduction--------------------------------------

Our proyect, PowertechGaming is a leading e-commerce company offering an online marketplace platform
 for IT computer components, consumer electronics, entertainment, smart home and gaming products.

Actually our website has a four sections, first of all we have the store in the main page,
showing some available products, we have also a section of "About us", with basically some
information about us and our services. In the third section we have the "Techincal service"
with a form to request a quote for maintenance or repair. Finally we have the section of
"Contact us" with another form to fill and ask for help or information.

<----------------------------------------CONCLUSION---------------------------------------------->
<!--In this proyect, we have done an e-commerce store using only HTML and CSS, the website
it isn't finished yet because we only made the front end code but we will be working on it.
In this practice we have learned how to do a store in a simple but visibly attractive way for 
the client with the brand's own colors using combinations and gradients to give it our own style.
